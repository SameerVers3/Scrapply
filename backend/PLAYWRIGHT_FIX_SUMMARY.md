# Playwright Dependency Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The backend was experiencing a Playwright dependency issue with the error:
```
Failed to detect dynamic content for https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_100&sort=user_rating,desc: 
Executable doesn't exist at /opt/render/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1091/chrome-linux/chrome
```

## Root Cause
1. **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: The system was using Python 3.13, which is too new for many packages including the older version of Playwright (1.40.0) specified in requirements.txt
2. **Missing Browser Binaries**: Even if Playwright was installed, the Chromium browser binaries were not downloaded
3. **System Package Conflicts**: The system was using an externally managed Python environment, preventing proper package installation

## Solution Steps

### 1. Created Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Installed System Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3.13-venv libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libpq-dev
```

### 3. Upgraded Build Tools
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 4. Installed Compatible Playwright Version
```bash
pip install playwright  # Installs latest version (1.54.0) compatible with Python 3.13
```

### 5. Downloaded Browser Binaries
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### 6. Installed Essential Dependencies
```bash
pip install pydantic-settings fastapi uvicorn
```

## Verification
Created and ran test scripts to verify:
- ✅ Playwright can initialize properly
- ✅ Chromium browser can be launched
- ✅ Pages can be navigated and content retrieved
- ✅ Dynamic content detection works

## Files Modified/Created
- `venv/` - Virtual environment directory
- `test_playwright_simple.py` - Test script to verify functionality
- `test_playwright_fix.py` - More comprehensive test script
- `PLAYWRIGHT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps
1. **Update requirements.txt** to use the newer Playwright version
2. **Set up proper environment variables** for the application
3. **Install remaining dependencies** as needed
4. **Test the full application** to ensure everything works together

## Environment Setup
To use the fixed environment:
```bash
cd /workspace/backend
source venv/bin/activate
# Now you can run the application with Playwright working
```

## Notes
- The newer Playwright version (1.54.0) is compatible with Python 3.13
- Browser binaries are now properly installed in the user's cache directory
- The virtual environment isolates dependencies from system packages
- All dynamic content detection functionality should now work correctly
