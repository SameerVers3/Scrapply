# **Nexus Platform - MVP Requirements Document**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## **1. Executive Summary**

The Nexus MVP focuses on delivering core autonomous web-to-API conversion functionality with a simplified agent architecture. This MVP will validate the core concept while establishing a foundation for the full platform.

## **2. MVP Scope & Constraints**

### **In Scope:**
- Single-agent scraper generation for static websites
- Basic API endpoint creation and testing
- Simple web interface for user interaction
- Fundamental error handling and refinement loop
- Support for common HTML structures and basic pagination

### **Out of Scope (Future Versions):**
- Complex JavaScript-rendered sites (SPA support)
- Multi-step refinement chains
- User authentication and multi-tenancy
- Advanced monitoring and analytics
- Complex anti-bot countermeasures

## **3. Core User Stories**

### **Primary User Story:**
As a **data analyst**, I want to **input a website URL and describe the data I need in plain English**, so that I can **receive a working API endpoint that provides structured JSON data** without writing any code.

### **Supporting User Stories:**

1. **URL Input & Description**
   - As a user, I want to enter a website URL and describe my data requirements in natural language
   - Acceptance: Simple form accepts URL and text description

2. **Automatic Scraper Generation**
   - As a user, I want the system to automatically analyze the website and create a scraper
   - Acceptance: System generates Python scraping code based on requirements

3. **API Endpoint Creation**
   - As a user, I want to receive a working API endpoint that returns my requested data
   - Acceptance: System creates a FastAPI endpoint returning JSON data

4. **Basic Testing & Validation**
   - As a user, I want confidence that my API works correctly
   - Acceptance: System validates API responses before exposing to user

5. **Error Handling**
   - As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong
   - Acceptance: System provides meaningful error messages and retry options

## **4. Functional Requirements**

### **4.1 Web Interface Requirements**

| Requirement ID | Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FRQ-UI-001 | Simple input form | Must Have | Form with URL field, description textarea, submit button |
| FRQ-UI-002 | Progress indicator | Must Have | Visual feedback during processing (loading, analyzing, testing, ready) |
| FRQ-UI-003 | Results display | Must Have | Shows generated API endpoint URL and sample JSON response |
| FRQ-UI-004 | Error messaging | Must Have | Clear error messages for failures with suggested actions |
| FRQ-UI-005 | API testing interface | Should Have | Simple way to test the generated API endpoint |

### **4.2 Backend Processing Requirements**

| Requirement ID | Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FRQ-BE-001 | URL validation | Must Have | Validates URL format and accessibility |
| FRQ-BE-002 | Website analysis | Must Have | Determines if site is static/dynamic, identifies data elements |
| FRQ-BE-003 | Scraper generation | Must Have | Generates Python code using BeautifulSoup/Requests |
| FRQ-BE-004 | API endpoint creation | Must Have | Creates FastAPI route that executes scraper and returns JSON |
| FRQ-BE-005 | Automated testing | Must Have | Tests generated API for basic functionality |
| FRQ-BE-006 | Code sandboxing | Must Have | Executes generated code in secure, isolated environment |

### **4.3 Data Processing Requirements**

| Requirement ID | Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| FRQ-DP-001 | HTML parsing | Must Have | Extract data from static HTML using CSS selectors |
| FRQ-DP-002 | Data normalization | Must Have | Convert extracted data to consistent JSON format |
| FRQ-DP-003 | Schema generation | Should Have | Automatically infer data schema from examples |
| FRQ-DP-004 | Basic pagination | Should Have | Handle simple "next page" links |
| FRQ-DP-005 | Error recovery | Must Have | Graceful handling of extraction failures |

## **5. Technical Constraints**

### **5.1 Simplified Agent Architecture**
- **Single Agent Approach:** One unified agent handles planning, scraping, and API generation
- **No Dynamic Agent Creation:** Fixed workflow instead of dynamic agent orchestration
- **Basic Refinement:** Maximum 2 retry attempts instead of complex feedback loops

### **5.2 Technology Limitations**
- **Static Sites Only:** No JavaScript rendering (Playwright/Selenium excluded from MVP)
- **Basic Security:** Simple sandboxing instead of full Docker isolation
- **Local Storage:** File-based persistence instead of database
- **Single User:** No authentication or multi-tenancy

### **5.3 Performance Constraints**
- **Response Time:** API generation should complete within 60 seconds
- **Concurrency:** Support for 5 concurrent requests maximum
- **Memory Usage:** Limit scraper execution to 512MB RAM
- **Storage:** Maximum 100MB for generated code and cached data

## **6. MVP User Flow**

```
1. User visits Nexus web interface
2. User enters:
   - Target website URL
   - Natural language description of required data
3. System validates URL and begins processing
4. System analyzes website structure
5. System generates Python scraper code
6. System creates FastAPI endpoint
7. System tests the endpoint automatically
8. If test fails:
   - System attempts one refinement iteration
   - If still fails, shows error with suggestions
9. If test passes:
   - System displays success message
   - Shows API endpoint URL
   - Displays sample JSON response
   - Provides simple API documentation
```

## **7. Success Metrics**

### **7.1 Technical Metrics**
- **Success Rate:** >70% of requests result in working APIs
- **Response Time:** <60 seconds average processing time
- **Uptime:** >95% system availability
- **Error Rate:** <10% of requests fail with system errors

### **7.2 User Experience Metrics**
- **Task Completion:** >80% of users successfully generate an API
- **User Satisfaction:** >4/5 average rating on ease of use
- **Error Understanding:** >90% of users understand error messages

## **8. Risk Mitigation**

### **8.1 Technical Risks**

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Website structure changes | High | Medium | Implement robust selector strategies |
| Anti-bot detection | High | Medium | Use respectful crawling practices |
| Code generation failures | Medium | Medium | Fallback templates and validation |
| Sandboxing vulnerabilities | High | Low | Strict execution limits and validation |

### **8.2 Business Risks**

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low user adoption | High | Medium | Focus on UX and clear value proposition |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Implement proper resource limits |
| Legal/ethical concerns | High | Low | Respect robots.txt and rate limiting |
